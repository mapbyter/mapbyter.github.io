                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>400 ml water</li>
                        <li>Packet of instant yeast</li>
                        <li>650g all purpose flour, divided</li>
                        <li>50g sugar</li>
                        <li>5g salt</li>
                        <li>90g unsalted butter, divided</li>
                        <li>Plastic wrap</li>
                        <li>Parchment paper</li>
                        <li>A little oil</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>In a bowl, combine 100 ml of warm (110°F) water with one packet of instant yeast and 325g of the all purpose flour along with 50g of sugar, 5g of salt, and 45g of unsalted butter at room temperature.</li>
                        <li>Stir to combine before adding 300 ml of water and stirring to create a pancake batter like paste, and then add the remaining 325g of flour and stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
                        <li>Turn out onto a counter top and knead for 7-9 minutes until a smooth supple dough forms.</li>
                        <li>Generously oil a large bowl and place the dough inside. Roll the dough around a little to make sure it’s evenly coated in oil.</li>
                        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes to an hour until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
                        <li>Turn out onto a lightly floured countertop and punch down until it’s back to its original size and then start forming into a loaf. Make sure to tuck it under itself to make sure it gets that nice loaf top.</li>
                        <li>Place in a loaf pan that is coated with butter and parchment paper and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature for one hour until it has doubled in size.</li>
                        <li>Brush the loaf down with butter and place in a 400° oven for 25-35 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the oven and brush it down again with some more butter and let sit overnight.</li>

                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>1 cup + 2 tablespoons warm water</li>
                        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                        <li>1 3/4 teaspoons salt</li>
                        <li>16 ounces (about 3 1/3 to 3 1/2 cups) bread flour</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the water, yeast, sugar, and butter. Add in the salt. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and begin to gradually add the flour on low speed. Increase speed to medium and knead the dough for about 7 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
                        <li>Remove the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
                        <li>Divide the dough into 12 (2 ounce) portions. Roll each piece of dough into a 7-inch log. Place the dough logs on nonstick baking mat or parchment-lined baking sheets, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven and immediately brush with melted butter. Combine the salt and garlic powder and sprinkle evenly over breadsticks. Serve warm.</li>

                    <br>
                    <img class="img-responsive thumbnail rec-pic" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/08/21/13/44/cinnamon-rolls-4421067__340.jpg">
                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        For the dough:
                        <li>¾ cup warm milk (whole milk or 2% preferred) (110° F)</li>
                        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons quick rise or active yeast (1/4-ounce package yeast)</li>
                        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1 egg plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
                        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                        <li>3 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</li>
                        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                        For the filling:
                        <li>2/3 cup dark brown sugar (light brown sugar also works)</li>
                        <li>1 ½ tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
                        <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
                        For the cream cheese frosting:
                        <li>4 oz cream cheese, softened</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
                        <li>¾ cup powdered sugar</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>Warm milk to around 110 degrees F. I like to do this by placing milk in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving it for 40-45 seconds. It should be like warm bath water. Transfer warm milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Next stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.</li>
                        <li>Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. If it's TOO sticky (meaning it's sticking to the bottom of the mixer, add in 2 tablespoons more bread flour.) If you don’t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.</li>
                        <li>Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour to 1 ½ hours, or until doubled in size. This may more or less time depending the humidity and temperature in your home.</li>
                        <li>After dough has doubled in size, transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough, leaving a ¼ inch margin at the far side of the dough.</li>
                        <li>In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.</li>
                        <li>Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can. You will probably need to cut off about an inch off the ends of the dough as the ends won’t be as full of cinnamon sugar as we’d want it to be.</li>
                        <li>Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces.</li>
                        <li>Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30-45 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that’s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls.</li>
                        <li>To make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
