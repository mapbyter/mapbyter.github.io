                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>1 1/2 cups (298g) granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>4 large eggs</li>
                        <li>1 cup (227g) milk (whole, 2% or 1%)</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (149g) vegetable oil</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon (14g) vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract, optional; for enhanced flavor</li>
                        <li>2 cups (241g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>3 tablespoons (16g) Double-Dutch Dark Cocoa</li>
                        <li>3/4 teaspoon espresso powder, optional; for enhanced flavor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly spray a 9" x 2" round baking pan with cooking spray. Line the bottom of the pan with a circle of parchment, and spritz again. Set the pan aside.</li>
                        <li>In the bowl of your mixer, beat the sugar and eggs until lightened, about 2 minutes. On low speed beat in the oil, milk, vanilla extract, and optional almond extract until smooth.</li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk to remove any lumps. Add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients. Combine on medium speed 1-2 minutes or until the batter is smooth and lump free. Be sure to scrape down the bowl halfway through mixing.</li>
                        <li>Remove 2 cups of the vanilla batter and place it in the measure you used for the liquid ingredients. Sift the cocoa and optional espresso powder over this batter, and stir well to combine. Be sure to use a sifter to avoid cocoa lumps in the batter.</li>
                        <li>Now for the stripes. Spoon about 3 tablespoons of vanilla batter into the center of the cake pan. Next, spoon 3 tablespoons of the chocolate batter into the center of the vanilla batter. This causes the vanilla batter to spread out. Continue to alternate batters, in bulls-eye fashion until all batter is used. You will now have thin rings of each batter on the outer edges of the pan, thicker rings towards the center.</li>
                        <li>Bake the cake in the center of the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the cake is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto a wire rack to finish cooling. Frost as desired; we're partial to the frosting paired with our Vanilla Cake Pan Cake recipe.</li>

                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <b>For the Cake</b>
                        <li>3 cups all purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off with a knife</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1 cup buttermilk (low fat is fine)</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons grated lemon zest, packed (see note)</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                        <li>2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                        <li>2-1/4 cups granulated sugar, plus more for the pan</li>
                        <li>3 large eggs</li>
                        <b>For the Syrup</b>
                        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1-1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                        <b>For the Glaze</b>
                        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.</li>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, lemon zest and lemon juice. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or beaters), cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again.</li>
                        <li>With the mixer on low speed, beat in one-quarter of the flour mixture, then one-third of the buttermilk mixture. Beat in another quarter of the flour, then another third of the buttermilk mixture. Repeat with another quarter of the flour and the remaining buttermilk mixture. Finally, beat in the remaining flour mixture. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and give a quick mix to make sure all of the ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
                        <li>Thoroughly grease a 10-inch Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray or vegetable shortening, making sure to get into all the crevices. Coat the greased pan generously with granulated sugar, making sure the entire surface of the pan is evenly coated.</li>
                        <li>Spoon the thick batter into the prepared Bundt pan and smooth with a rubber spatula. Bake for 65 to 75 minutes, or until the cake is golden and a tester comes out clean.</li>
                        <li>Set the cake on a cooling rack. Carefully run an offset spatula or table knife around the edges of your pan, between the pan and the cake, to loosen the cake from the pan (don't forget the center tube). Cool the cake in the pan for ten minutes. (Set a timer because if it stays in the pan too long, it may stick.)</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, make the syrup. Combine the water and sugar in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice.</li>
                        <li>Invert the warm cake onto a rack. Slip a large piece of parchment paper, aluminum foil, or paper towels under the rack for easy clean-up. Gradually brush the hot syrup over the cake, letting it soak in (a little syrup will drip off, but try not to rush so that most of it is absorbed). Allow the cake to cool completely, about one hour.</li>
                        <li>When the cake is cool, carefully transfer it to a serving platter. To make the glaze: in a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice. Add more confectioners' sugar or lemon juice as necessary to make a thick but pourable glaze (it should be a little thicker than you'd think, about the consistency of molasses or honey). Spoon the glaze over the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides.</li>

                        <b>For the Cake</b>
                        <li>1 and 3/4 cups (220g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder</li>

                        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional)</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola oil or melted coconut oil)</li>
                        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature*</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1 cup (240ml) buttermilk*</li>
                        <li>1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee (regular or decaf)*</li>
                        <b>For the Frosting</b>
                        <li>1.25 cups (2.5 sticks or 290g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
                        <li>3–4 cups (360-480g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or dutch process)*</li>
                        <li>3–5 Tablespoons (45-75ml) heavy cream (or half-and-half or milk), at room temperature</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>optional for decoration: semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.</li>
                        <li><b>Make the cake:</b> Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.</li>
                        <li>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: Even if they’re completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center. Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It’s normal!)</li>
                        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.</li>
                        <li><b>Make the buttercream:</b> With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy – about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or another Tablespoon of cream if frosting is too thick. Taste. Add more salt if needed. (I usually add another pinch.)</li>
                        <li><b>Assemble and frost:</b> If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.</li>
                        <li>Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.</li>
